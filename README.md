    ```

4. **What Happens During Installation**:

    - **Migrations & Seeders**:
        - All migrations and seeders from the core or base Laravel project are executed to set up the database schema and populate initial data.

        - Additional seeders are generated and executed to ensure the database is fully populated with the required default configurations.

5. **Admin Account Setup**

    - After the installation process, the command prompts you to provide **Admin Login Credentials** (email and password).
    - These credentials are used to log in to the admin panel.

6. **Installation Complete**  
   Once the above steps are finished, the installation process is complete, and you can start using Aureus ERP.
